# ComputationalPhysics_UsingMatlab
Included in this repository are my answers to problems in the "Applied Numerical Methods Matlab" by Stephen Chapra 
3rd edition textbook. This was for the Phy 329 course at UT Austin titled "Computational Physics"

In the final project, I used a Runge-kutta method to solve the equations of motion for a pendulum. The code is in the dydtsys.m and  rk4sys.m files
